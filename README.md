# CS350
- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  - In this two diffrent projects we were flashing the lights on the board. With one we were flashing morse code, in the other we would turn the led on and off by typing on or off.
- What did you do particularly well?
  - I think I completed the wanted result with both the morse code with button inputs and the ON and Off feataures of the typed input.
- Where could you improve?
  - While I completed the task I do think there are always better ways to create a feature.
- What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  - I used Code Composer Studio during these projects and I will continue to use it for C programming.
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  - Working with the limitations a embedded system has is a valueable skill that I learned from this projects
- How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  - I tried to stay with industry standards when I wrote the code I used, and tryed to add some modularity with the features. This makes it easier to read, edit, and reuse.
